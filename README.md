# ACM Tutor Bot 
* This is a tutor bot for my local ACM chapter's discord server, of which I am the president of. 
* Students can ask questions and get answers from the tutors. 
* The bot uses OpenAI's GPT-5 API to generate responses.
* The bot uses a MongoDB database to store conversation history and to better respond to follow up questions.
* The bot is hosted on a personal Rasperry Pi 5.
